Accomplish the task below by decomposing it as many very explicit subtasks as possible, be very explicit and thorough denoted by 
a search process, highlighted by markers ‘1’,..., ‘3’ as “first operations” guiding subtree exploration for the OBJECTIVE, 
focus on the third subtree exploration. Produce prospective search steps (e.g., the subtree exploration ‘5. 11 + 1’) 
and evaluates potential subsequent steps to either progress
towards a solution or retrace to another viable subtree then be very thorough 
and think atomically then provide solutions for those subtasks, 
then return the definitive end result and then summarize it
